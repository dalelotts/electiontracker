#summary Learn how to add a "AboutBox" style form to the project.


= Introduction =

An "AboutBox" style is a form that pops up, but is not called through makeMDIChildForm().

= The Code =

Looking at how the original AboutBox is made we find these lines of code:

{{{
public event GenericEventHandler<object, ShowAboutBoxArgs> showAboutBox;
...
aboutToolStripMenuItem.Click += new EventHandler(AboutBoxHandler);
...
private void AboutBoxHandler(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    try
    {
        EventUtil.RaiseEvent<object, ShowAboutBoxArgs>(showAboutBox, this, new ShowAboutBoxArgs());
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        reportException("AboutBoxHandler", ex);
    }
}


}}}
ShowAboutBoxArgs is defined as

{{{
namespace KnightRider.ElectionTracker.events {
    internal sealed class ShowAboutBoxArgs : EventArgs {}
}
}}}

= Flow =

  # User clicks "About..."
  # AboutBoxHandler() is invoked because of "aboutToolStripMenuItem.Click += new EventHandler(AboutBoxHandler);"
  # RaiseEvent(showAboutBox, this, new ShowAboutBoxArgs()) is called.
  # showAboutBox(this, ShowAboutBoxArgs()) is called.
