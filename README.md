#ElectionTracker
This was Written as a class project while I was attending UWEC in 2005. I have since stopped working in .Net
This application was written for the Eau Claire office of Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR).

## Original description
I am hoping this application can serve as an example – perhaps even a template – for building simple Windows Forms applications using Spring and nHibernate. 
Once everything is working nicely I will thoroughly document the source code regarding the reasons for various design decisions and implementations. (I obvoiusly never got around to this part)
