#ElectionTracker
This was written as a class project while I was attending UWEC in 2005. This was my first .Net project, and likely my last. =)

This application was written for the Eau Claire office of Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR).

## Original description
I am hoping this application can serve as an example – perhaps even a template – for building simple Windows Forms applications using Spring and nHibernate. 

Once everything is working nicely I will thoroughly document the source code regarding the reasons for various design decisions and implementations. (I obvoiusly never got around to this part)
