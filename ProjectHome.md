Originally written as a class project while I was attending UWEC.  This application was written for the Eau Claire office of  Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR).

I am hoping this application can serve as an example – perhaps even a template – for building simple Windows Forms applications using Spring and nHibernate. Once everything is working nicely I will thoroughly document the source code regarding the reasons for various design decisions and implementations.
