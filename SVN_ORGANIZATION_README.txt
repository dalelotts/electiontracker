There are several versions of the Election Tracker software here on the 
SVN. 

The current working version that is being used by WPR at this time is
located in the trunk folder.

Within the branches folder there are two other versions housed each in their own
folder. The first, named pre2010modifications, is the version of the Election
Tracker Software before the Software Engineering II group from fall 2010.

The second is named mysqlConnector. This is a work in progress version 
of the Election Tracker with a new data access layer to replace the
NHibernate and springs. Documentation for this new data access layer can
be found in the mysqlConnector/doc/ folder.
